# Active Work - CRAFTING LAB Landing Page

## Current Focus
✅ Code analysis completed - reviewing entire codebase

## In Progress
- [x] Analyzed package.json and dependencies
- [x] Reviewed all React components (Navbar, Hero, Marquee, About, Services, Works, Clients, Footer, FadeIn)
- [x] Examined layout and main page structure
- [x] Reviewed CSS styling (globals.css)
- [x] Checked configuration files (tsconfig.json, next.config.ts)

## Just Completed
- Full codebase exploration and analysis
- Created memory system for project
- Updated `Works` production showcase arc to a CSS-driven white rounded border on the left of `production-right`
- Converted `Works` production showcase from auto-rotating thumbnails to click-driven thumbnail selection synced with the center video card
- Compressed downloaded production videos in `public/assets/works/videos` for web delivery
- Generated lightweight JPG thumbnails for production videos and wired `Works` to use real video playback with separate thumbnail assets
- Tightened mobile responsiveness to reduce horizontal overflow risks in hero, about, success text, footer, and production sections
- Applied a broader page-wide responsive pass across hero, marquee, about, photo carousel, services, works, production, sports banner, clients, footer, and navbar
- Restored the production curve SVG in `Works` and kept it hidden on mobile/tablet via existing responsive CSS
- Refined the responsive system with section-by-section polish: fluid navbar sizing and scroll offset handling, unified `btn-view-more` styles, variable-driven marquee/photo carousel motion, stronger tablet footer layout, and a cleaner desktop/mobile production thumbnail layout
- Fixed the desktop `production-curve` visibility regression by allowing overflow on `production-right` while preserving clipping on tablet/mobile

## Just Completed
- Implemented Services page (`/services`) from Figma design (node 650-14263)
  - `src/app/services/page.tsx` — route with Navbar + ServicesPage + Footer
  - `src/components/ServicesPage.tsx` — full services page with 3 service blocks (Strategy, Branding, Production), subcards with icons, tags, back-to-top button
  - `public/assets/services/` — hero webp images + SVG icons for each subcard + service-lines.svg decoration
  - CSS added to globals.css under `/* SERVICES PAGE (/services) */` using `.sp-*` prefix
  - Added `service-lines.svg` as decorative background to subcards section
  - Fixed CSS class mismatches (`.sp-subcards` → `.sp-subcards-container`) in responsive media queries
- Reduced `Clients` marquee from 3 rows to 2 rows by merging the third row logos into the second row and removing the extra marquee block
- Slowed the `Clients` marquee animation from `30s` to `45s` for a calmer logo scroll pace
- Tuned `Clients` row speeds separately so the longer second row scrolls slower (`80s`) and feels closer to the first row (`45s`)
- Added an entrance animation to the active `Works` production video so iframe swaps feel smoother on thumbnail change
- Reworked the `Works` production video swap animation to use GSAP on the card itself, making the transition visible during iframe changes
- Reduced `Works` production video swap jank by keeping the card mounted and fading the iframe in over a thumbnail poster while YouTube reloads
- Upgraded `Works` production poster images from YouTube `hqdefault` to `maxresdefault` thumbnails for sharper loading states
- Fixed a React 19 ref callback typing error in `Works` by making the slide ref assignment callback return `void`
- Simplified `VideoProductionSection` to render at most 3 visible video cards around the active item instead of mapping the full repeated track
- Verified the latest `VideoProductionSection` carousel change with a successful `pnpm run build`
- Installed `embla-carousel-react@^8.6.0` to prepare shared carousel logic for the works video and photography sections
- Verified the Embla dependency install with a successful `pnpm run build`
- Migrated `VideoProductionSection` to Embla with a centered 3-card carousel, an `All` filter tab, and side-card thumbnail posters that promote the selected YouTube Short into the center embed
- Replaced `VideoProductionSection` local MP4 sources with the provided YouTube Shorts embeds and YouTube poster thumbnails
- Verified the Embla-based `VideoProductionSection` implementation with a successful `pnpm run build`
- Refined `VideoProductionSection` center playback to follow the `Works` pattern: full-card poster background, inline YouTube player shell, and iframe fade-in on load to avoid the broken full-height black area
- Verified the refined `VideoProductionSection` inline player layout with a successful `pnpm run build`
- Switched `VideoProductionSection` center card to reuse the same `production-video-card` / `production-video-stage` / `production-video-poster` / `production-video` structure as `Works`, with only local size overrides inside the Embla card
- Verified the exact `Works` player structure reuse in `VideoProductionSection` with a successful `pnpm run build`
- Disabled Embla's native loop animation in `VideoProductionSection` and replaced edge wrapping with instant arrow-triggered jumps so the carousel no longer animates visibly to the tail
- Verified the latest `VideoProductionSection` wrap behavior change with a successful `pnpm run build`
- Migrated `VideoProductionSection` from `embla-carousel-react` to `react-slick`, keeping the centered overlay player while moving slide movement/cloning to Slick
- Added `react-slick`, `slick-carousel`, and `@types/react-slick`, then removed the now-unused `embla-carousel-react` dependency
- Verified the `react-slick` migration with successful production builds before and after removing `Embla`
- Reworked `VideoProductionSection` again to use `Swiper` as a page-based slider where each slide represents one page of up to 3 videos, so 5 videos render as page 1 with 3 cards and page 2 with 2 cards
- Removed the abandoned `react-slick`, `slick-carousel`, and `@types/react-slick` dependencies after the `Swiper` migration
- Verified the `Swiper` page-based implementation with a successful `pnpm run build`
- Fixed a `Maximum update depth exceeded` loop in `VideoProductionSection` by memoizing the filtered video list and deriving the page-loading effect from a stable `currentPage` reference
- Added the missing core Swiper layout CSS for `swiper-wrapper` and `swiper-slide`, fixing the issue where all video pages rendered visibly at once instead of one page at a time
- Removed the per-video loading opacity gate in `VideoProductionSection` because the YouTube iframe could stay hidden behind the poster; video players now render immediately instead of getting stuck on thumbnails
- Reworked `VideoProductionSection` pages so each page has only one active playing video at a time; inactive cards are now smaller poster previews, and the active card scales up slightly when playing
- Refined `VideoProductionSection` alignment and visual hierarchy: 3-card pages now default the active player to the middle card, 2-card/1-card pages shrink their row width to the real item count, and the active card now uses a subtler lifted scale treatment
- Removed the active-card scale effect from `VideoProductionSection`, keeping only the center alignment and subtle opacity/saturation contrast
- Unified the `VideoProductionSection` card framing so active and inactive items now share the same shell/viewport, with the active state only swapping the poster media to a YouTube player inside that existing frame
- Replaced the `VideoProductionSection` pagination arrows with custom neon line-arrow SVG icons and removed the previous circular button treatment
- Disabled autoplay for the active YouTube player in `VideoProductionSection`; videos now stay paused until the user presses play
- Removed the `VideoProductionSection` active-card gate so every visible card now mounts its own YouTube iframe immediately, keeps the poster visible while loading, and fades the player in once `onLoad` completes
- Added a visible loading overlay to `VideoProductionSection` thumbnails while each YouTube iframe loads, including a neon spinner and loading chip, and restored the shared desktop `wk-vp-card-shell` frame styling
- Attempted to read the provided Figma file/node via MCP, but direct access is currently blocked because `FIGMA_API_KEY` is not configured in the environment
- Updated the `PhotographySection` headline typography to match the provided spec more closely, switching `wk-ph-title` to a centered Century Gothic outlined treatment with the requested stroke, size, weight, spacing, and capitalization
- Made the `PhotographySection` headline responsive by converting its stroke, size, and letter spacing to `clamp(...)`, preserving the large desktop treatment while keeping the word on one line across smaller breakpoints
- Reworked the `PhotographySection` fan layout to overlap the five cards like the reference by removing the flex gap, adding negative spacing between cards, and assigning higher `z-index` to the center cards while keeping mobile in a non-overlapping horizontal scroll layout
- Tuned the `PhotographySection` fan layout closer to the reference by increasing desktop/tablet card overlap and pulling the stacked images upward so they visually overlap the outlined `PHOTOGRAPHY` headline, while preserving the simpler mobile layout
- Increased the `PhotographySection` fan lift further to match the reference more closely, setting the desktop stack to `margin-top: -200px` and tablet to `-140px`
- Separated the `PhotographySection` footer from the overlapping image stack by increasing `wk-ph-footer` top spacing and giving the footer its own positioned layer above the fan
- Updated `wk-ph-cat` to the requested Century Gothic typography spec and changed `PHOTO_CATEGORIES` to title case so the photography category label renders as capitalized text instead of all caps
- Replaced the `PhotographySection` footer's text arrows with the provided neon SVG arrow shape, mirroring the same right-arrow path for the left button and adding a dedicated `wk-ph-arrow-icon` size rule
- Updated the `PhotographySection` left arrow to use the exact left-arrow SVG path provided by the user instead of a mirrored right-arrow transform

## Next Steps
- Ready for feature requests or modifications
- Can improve design, add functionality, or fix issues
- Available for deployment or further development

## Current Task Notes
- Started conservative Hero/LCP pass: added `fetchPriority="high"` to the navbar logo image and hero background image, plus a fixed logo `sizes` hint; verified with `pnpm run build`
- Completed low-risk image loading pass: removed below-fold image priority and added responsive `sizes` in `src/components/home/Works.tsx`, `src/components/home/About.tsx`, and `src/components/home/PhotoCarousel.tsx`; verified with `pnpm run build`
- Fixed Lighthouse heading-order warning by changing footer column labels from `h4.footer-col-title` to `p.footer-col-title` in `src/components/Footer.tsx`; verified with `pnpm run build`
- Fixed invalid Codex skill metadata for `seo-analysis` and `seo-page` by shortening their `description` frontmatter below the 1024-character loader limit
- Installed additional Codex skills from `nowork-studio/toprank`: SEO (`broken-link-checker`, `content-writer`, `keyword-research`, `meta-tags-optimizer`, `schema-markup-generator`, `seo-analysis`, `seo-page`, `setup-cms`) and Google Ads (`ads-audit`, `ads-copy`, `ads-landing`, `ads`)
- Installed Codex skill `toprank-upgrade-skill` from `nowork-studio/toprank` path `toprank-upgrade-skill` into `/Users/rotoon/.codex/skills/toprank-upgrade-skill`
- Read Figma file `0QWfGP3yT9dnmoFiBEwSyC` node `2104:10164` successfully via MCP
- Confirmed the node is a multi-brand portfolio board, not a single landing-page frame
- Identified the colored logo node for each lower brand variant under the board
- Added `public/assets/brand-logos-real/manifest.json` mapping 20 brand entries to their lower variant and logo node IDs for direct export later
- Confirmed some logos export cleanly as SVG, but larger ones are truncated in tool output; PNG export is the safer bulk-export path
- Created `public/assets/works/portfolio/details/clients/` and populated it with 23 client logo files named by work/detail slug where possible
- Updated `src/components/works/data.ts` so all `WORK_DETAILS.logo` paths now point to `/assets/works/portfolio/details/clients/*`
